# AreYouFree
CMPS183 Project based on Jenna Wu's HW 3 and teachings from https://bitbucket.org/luca_de_alfaro/web2py_start_2016.

This app was not developed with the best git practices (like working on different branches)... we only ran into one merge conflict surprisingly! 

See a live demo here: http://pfonck.pythonanywhere.com/areyoufree/
